# LumiCube
 a Lighting Assistant for Workspace

LumiCube is a lighting assistant for our workspace, it can help us know the current lighting in the workspace easily:
1) light intensity and color temperature.
2) what kind of work activity is suitable under the lighting.
3) how to set good lighting for the current task.

Basically, LumiCube has two modes: work mode and relax mode.

1) Work mode
- measure and display real-time Light intensity and color temperature.
- inform what type of work activity is suitable under the lighting.
- imply how to set good lighting for different tasks.

2) Relax mode:
- provide weather info: temperature and weather description.
- give outdoor clothing/equipment tips
